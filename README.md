# Emotion Detection Web App
A Flask-based AI web applilcation that detects from user input text using IBM Watson NLP

## Project Overview
This was built as the final project for the IBM Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask Course. It demonstrates the full pipeline of building and deploying an AI-based web application using Python, Flask, and Watson NLP services.

## Features 
- **Emotion Detection**: Uses Watson NLP to classify emotions like joy, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness from raw text.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clean and structured code using modular Python functions.
- **Web Deployment**: Built and deployed using Flask, with user-friendly HTML interface.
- **Error Handling**: Displays meaningful error messages when the user submits blank or invalid inputs.
- **Unit Testing**: Functions tested for reliability and accuracy.
- **PEP8 Compliance**: Achieved a perfect 10/10 score with Pylint.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding
- Pylint
- HTML/CSS
